My preferred style is definitely realism in black and white, but I also like to adapt to other wishes and create an individual and unique design for each customer. Before the tattoo appointment, I like to arrange a personal consultation to discuss everything with the customer. I think it is important to take the time to meet and discuss different options and possibilities.",
